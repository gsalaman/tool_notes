# Glenn's notes for the plasma cutter

## 1st step:  Drawing
Need a .dxf of what you want to cut.  I've done these out of onshape, but you can do Illustrator as well.  There are sometimes some "arc" issues with onshape projections...best to check in illustrator that the lines are as you want them.

## 2nd step:  Enroute
This program takes your DXF and creates toolpaths (gcode).
